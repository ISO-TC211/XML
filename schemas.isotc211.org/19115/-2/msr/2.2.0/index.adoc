=== Description

MSR 2.2 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-2:2019 (Ed2),
Geographic Information - Metadata - Part 2: Extensions for acquisition and
processing, Clause 6.3.4. The MRL 2.2 schema is an extension of MRL 1.3 as defined in
ISO 19115-1, Geographic Information - Metadata - Part 1: Fundamentals. It includes
additional elements for describing lineage, processes and sources. The XML schema was
encoded using the rules described in ISO/TS 19139:2007.

=== XML Namespace for Metadata for Spatial Representation (MSR) [ISO 19115-2]

The namespace URI for Metadata for Spatial Representation (MSR) [ISO 19115-2] is
derived from ISO 19115-1 `https://schemas.isotc211.org/19115/-1/mrl/1.3`.

=== XML Schema for mrl 1.3

https://schemas.isotc211.org/19115/-1/msr/1.3.0/msr.xsd
is the XML Schema document to be referenced by XML documents containing XML elements
in the mrl 1.3 namespace or by XML Schema documents importing the msr 1.3 namespace.
The schema
https://schemas.isotc211.org/19115/-1/msr/1.3.0/msr.xsd
forms the basis for ISO 19115 Metadata for Spatial Representation definitions from
both ISO 19115-1 and ISO 19115-2. This XML schema includes (indirectly) all the
implemented concepts of the mrc namespace, but it does not contain the declaration of
any types.
