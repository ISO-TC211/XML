=== Description

MSR 2.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-1, Geographic
Information - Metadata - Part 1: Fundamentals AMENDMENT 1, Clause 6.5.7. It includes
elements for describing spatial representations of resources. The XML schema was
encoded using the rules described in ISO/TS 19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation
approach from ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.

=== XML Namespace for msr 2.0

The namespace URI for msr 2.0 is `http://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/-3/msr/2.0`.

=== XML Schema for msr 2.0

link:msr.xsd[msr.xsd] is the XML Schema document to be referenced by XML documents
containing XML elements in the msr 2.0 namespace or by XML Schema documents importing
the msr 2.0 namespace. This XML schema includes (indirectly) all the implemented
concepts of the msr namespace, but it does not contain the declaration of any types.

NOTE: The XML Schema for msr 2.0 are available link:msr.zip[here]. A zip archive
including all the XML Schema Implementations defined in ISO/TS 19115-3 and related
standards is also

link:spatialRepresentation.xsd[spatialRepresentation.xsd] implements the UML
conceptual schema defined in ISO 19115-1, Geographic Information - Metadata - Part 1:

MD_Georectified, MD_Georeferenceable, MD_GridSpatialRepresentation,
*MD_PixelOrientationCode*, *MD_TopologyLevelCode*, and MD_VectorSpatialRepresentation
