=== Description

MDT 1.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-1, Geographic
Information - Metadata - Part 1: Fundamentals, Clause 7.4.2, 7.4.3. It includes this
namespace contains all classes needed for a complete metadata record for any resource
and enables the description of data transfer (MX_*) elements. This is the most
inclusive of the ISO 19115-3 namespaces so it should be used in situations where all
19115-3 capabilities are required. The XML schema was encoded using the rules
described in ISO/TS 19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation approach from
ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.
