=== Description

MCC 1.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-1, Geographic
Information - Metadata - Part 1: Fundamentals, Clause 6.6.4. It includes abstract
classes shared by multiple namespaces and is required in order to enable
modularization of the XML implementation. The XML schema was encoded using the rules
described in ISO/TS 19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation approach from
ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.
