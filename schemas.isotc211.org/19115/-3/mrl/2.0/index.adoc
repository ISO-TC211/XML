=== Description

MRL 2.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-1, Geographic
Information - Metadata - Part 2: Extensions for acquisition and processing, Clause
6.3.3. It includes elements for describing resource lineage. The XML schema was
encoded using the rules described in ISO/TS 19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation
approach from ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.
