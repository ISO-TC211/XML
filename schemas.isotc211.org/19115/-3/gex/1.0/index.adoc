=== Description

GEX 1.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-1, Geographic
Information - Metadata - Part 1: Fundamentals, Clause 6.6.1. It includes elements for
specifying geospatial properties of a resource, including extent and spatial
reference systems. The XML schema was encoded using the rules described in ISO/TS
19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation approach from ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.
