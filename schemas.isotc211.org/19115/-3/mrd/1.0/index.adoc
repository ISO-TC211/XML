=== Description

MRD 1.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-1, Geographic
Information - Metadata - Part 1: Fundamentals, Clause 6.5.11. It includes elements
specifying how a resource is accessed. The XML schema was encoded using the rules
described in ISO/TS 19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation approach from
ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.
