== Introduction

This is the official repository of ISO/TC 211 XML Schemas.

Jointly managed by ISO/TC 211/XMG and Ribose.


== XSD documentation pages

XSD documentation pages are generated using the `build` workflow.

The `schemas.yml` file controls which schemas (identified by path)
should generate XSD documentation.

The resulting documentation per schema will be generated in the path:

* HTML page: `_site/{schema-path}/{xsd-name}/index.html`
* Diagrams: `_site/{schema-path}/{xsd-name}/diagrams/*.svg`


== Building documentation

[source,sh]
----
# removes generated artifacts
make clean

# makes _site
make all
