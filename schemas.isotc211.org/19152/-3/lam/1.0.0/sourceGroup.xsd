						Remarks: This allows reference to "Source" information objects using the

						An example might be "Source-9" where "Source" is the namespace identifier,

						This attribute is inherited from LA_Source in part 1 of this document. The

						S-100 are given below for backward compatibility. The DQ_Element attributes
