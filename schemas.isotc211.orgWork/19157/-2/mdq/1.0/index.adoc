=== Description

MDQ 1.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19157, Geographic
Information - Data Quality, Clause 6.4. It includes elements for describing the
quality of resources. The XML schema was encoded using the rules described in ISO/TS
19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation approach from ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.

=== XML Schema for mdq 1.0

link:mdq.xsd[mdq.xsd] is the XML Schema document to be referenced by XML documents
containing XML elements in the mdq 1.0 namespace or by XML Schema documents importing
the mdq 1.0 namespace. This XML schema includes (indirectly) all the implemented
concepts of the mdq namespace, but it does not contain the declaration of any types.

including all the XML Schema Implementations defined in ISO/TS 19115-3 and related
standards is also
