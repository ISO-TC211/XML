=== Description

CAT 1.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-1, Geographic
Information - Metadata - Part 1: Fundamentals, Clause 7.4.4. It includes elements for
codelist catalogues, and example catalogues. The XML schema was encoded using the
rules described in ISO/TS 19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation approach from
ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.

=== XML Namespace for cat 1.0

The namespace URI for cat 1.0 is `http://standards.iso.org/iso/19115/-3/cat/1.0`.

=== XML Schema for cat 1.0

link:cat.xsd[cat.xsd] is the XML Schema document to be referenced by XML documents
containing XML elements in the cat 1.0 namespace or by XML Schema documents importing
the cat 1.0 namespace. This XML schema includes (indirectly) all the implemented
concepts of the cat namespace, but it does not contain the declaration of any types.

NOTE: The XML Schema for cat 1.0 are available link:cat.zip[here]. A zip archive
including all the XML Schema Implementations defined in ISO/TS 19115-3 and related
standards is also
