=== Description

MCO 1.0 is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO 19115-1, Geographic
Information - Metadata - Part 1: Fundamentals, Clause 6.5.4. It includes elements for
describing resource and metadata constraints. The XML schema was encoded using the
rules described in ISO/TS 19139:2007, Clause 8 and implementation approach from
ISO/TS19115-3, Clause 8.
