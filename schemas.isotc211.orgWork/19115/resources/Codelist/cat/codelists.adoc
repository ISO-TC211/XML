| Entry | Definition

| geometryOnly | geometry objects without any additional structure which describes
topology
| topology1D | 1-dimensional topological complex; commonly called 'chain-node' topology
| planarGraph | 1-dimensional topological complex that is planar. (A planar graph is
a graph that can be drawn in a plane in such a way that no two edges intersect except
at a vertex.)
| fullPlanarGraph | 2-dimensional topological complex that is planar. (A
2-dimensional topological complex is commonly called 'full topology' in a
cartographic 2D environment.)
| surfaceGraph | 1-dimensional topological complex that is isomorphic to a subset of
a surface. (A geometric complex is isomorphic to a topological complex if their
elements are in a one-to-one, dimensional-and boundary-preserving correspondence to
one another.)
| fullSurfaceGraph | 2-dimensional topological complex that is isomorphic to a subset
of a surface
| topology3D | 3-dimensional topological complex. (A topological complex is a
collection of topological primitives that are closed under the boundary operations.)
| fullTopology3D | complete coverage of a 3D Euclidean coordinate space
| abstract | topological complex without any specified geometric realisation

| Entry | Definition

| loose | service instance is loosely coupled with a data instance, i.e. no
MD_DataIdentification class has to be described
| mixed | service instance is mixed coupled with a data instance, i.e.
MD_DataIdentification describes the associated data instance and additionally the
service instance might work with other external data instances
| tight | service instance is tightly coupled with a data instance, i.e.
MD_DataIdentification class MUST be described
