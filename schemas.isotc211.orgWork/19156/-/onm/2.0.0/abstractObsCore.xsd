				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>arbitrary event-specific parameter relevant to one or more Observations.

NOTE		This might be an environmental parameter, an instrument setting or input, or an event-specific sampling parameter that is not tightly bound to either the feature-of-interest or to the observation procedure.
NOTE		Parameters that are tightly bound to the procedure can be recorded as part of the procedure description.
The AbstractObservingProcedure is a generic or standard procedure, rather than an event-specific process. In this context, parameters bound to the observation act, such as instrument settings, calibrations or inputs, local position, detection limits, asset identifier, operator, may augment the description of a standard procedure.
EXAMPLE	A time sequence of observations of water quality in a well might be made at variable depths within the well. While these can be associated with specimens taken from the well at this depth as the features-of-interest, a more common approach is to identify the well itself as the feature-of-interest, and add a “samplingDepth” parameter to the observation. The sampling depth is of secondary interest compared to the temporal variation of water quality at the site.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:element name="phenomenonTime" type="TM_Object" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>time that the Result applies to the characteristic of the FeatureOfInterest being observed.

NOTE 1	The phenomenonTime is often the time the Sample has been taken.
NOTE 2	This is often the time of interaction by a sampling Procedure or observation Procedure with a real-world feature.
NOTE 3	If the result is the average of multiple samples taken at different times, then the phenomenonTime is the time interval over which these measurements were taken.</xs:documentation>

				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>instant of time when the result of the Observation became available.

EXAMPLE 1	The resultTime typically corresponds to when the Procedure associated with the Observation was completed. For some observations this is identical to the phenomenonTime. However, there are important cases where they differ.
EXAMPLE 2	Where a measurement is made on a specimen in a laboratory, the phenomenonTime is the time the specimen was retrieved from its host, while the resultTime is the time the laboratory procedure was applied.
EXAMPLE 3	The resultTime also supports disambiguation of repeat measurements made of the same property of a feature using the same procedure.
EXAMPLE 4	Where sensor observation results are post-processed, the resultTime is the post-processing time, while the phenomenonTime is the time of initial interaction with the world.
EXAMPLE 5	Simulations may be used to estimate the values for phenomena in the future or past. The phenomenonTime is the time that the result applies to, while the resultTime is the time that the simulation was executed.</xs:documentation>
