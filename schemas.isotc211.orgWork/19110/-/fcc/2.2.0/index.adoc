=== Description

Feature Cataloguing Common (FCC) is an XML Schema implementation derived from ISO
19110:2016, Geographic Information - Methodologies for feature cataloging. It
includes elements for cataloguing features. The XML schema was encoded using the
encoding rules defined in ISO 19118, ISO 19139.

=== XML Namespace for fcc 2.2

The namespace URI for fcc 2.2 is `https://schemas.isotc211.org/19110/-/fcc/2.2`.

=== XML Schema for fcc 1.2

https://schemas.isotc211.org/19110/-/fcc/2.2.0/.2.0/fcc.xsd[fcc.xsd] is the XML Schema document

by XML Schema documents importing the fcc 2.2 namespace. This XML schema includes
(indirectly) all the implemented concepts of the fcct namespace, but it does not
contain the declaration of any types.
